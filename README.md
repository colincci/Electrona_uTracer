# Electrona_uTracer

## Description
This project aims to provide the necessary tools to compare any number of vacuum tubes based on measured data, determine which tubes have matching characteristics, and provide visual representations of the match as well as some statistical information of the sample lot overall.

Once the dataframe has been rebuilt, all the subsequent functions are available and can be executed one-at-a-time in order.

# Electrona_uTracer

## Description
This project aims to provide the necessary tools to compare any number of vacuum tubes based on measured data, determine which tubes have matching characteristics, and provide visual representations of the match as well as some statistical information of the sample lot overall.

## Execution
1) Copy the path to a directory containing tube data files.  (There are samples files in a directory called 'SampleTubeData_1_to_196')

2) Open the Jupyter Notebook called "Electrona_uTracer_OneJupyter.ipynb".  

3) Run the top cell, and paste in the path

4) Enter a tube type (for the samples, the type is '5749')

5) Continue running each subsequent cell
